> DFS solution. For getting the correct answer, we should allow revisiting the visited node, but not in a way that loops in a cycle indefinitely. So for each node, we maintain `visited` as bit-encoded list of nodes
that have already been visited. This helps in removing this kind of unwanted infinite looping. Idea is to use `Dynamic Programming`, where dp[i][j] stores number of nodes to be visited to make all nodes visited, when we are currently on node `i` and the nodes that are already visited are encoded by the integer `visited`.

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dp[13][8197], n;
    
    int dfs(vector<vector<int> > &graph, int node, int numOfVisited, int visited) {
        
        if (dp[node][visited] != -1)
            return dp[node][visited];
        
        // if current node is not in the list of visited nodes, increase count of visited nodes
        if ((visited & (1<<node)) == 0)
            numOfVisited += 1;
        
        if (numOfVisited == n)
            return dp[node][visited] = ((visited & (1<<node)) > 0) ? 0 : 1; 
        
        // to stop infinite loop between parent-child
        dp[node][visited] = 1e7;
        
        // visited |= (1 << node);
        int ans = 1e7;
        for (auto it:graph[node]) 
            ans = min(ans, dfs(graph, it, numOfVisited, visited|(1<<node)));
                
        return dp[node][visited] = ans + 1;
    }
    
    int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        n = graph.size();
        
        // have some base case
        if (n < 4)
            return n-1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 13; i += 1) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 8196; j += 1)
                dp[i][j] = -1;
        }
        
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 1) {
            ans = min(ans, dfs(graph, i, 0, 0));
        }
        
        // answer -1, because length of path = num of nodes - 1
        return ans-1;
    }
};
